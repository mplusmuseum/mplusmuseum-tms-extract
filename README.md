### Convert tms-xml to json

To convert a tms-xml to json, try

    $ yarn start --silent convert < ../data/ExportForDAM_Objects_UCS.xml > objects.json

*Note*: the `--silent` is important, because yarn outputs a bit too much info normally

### Ingest json to elasticsearch

Lets say you are happy with the output, maybe ingest it to an elasticsearch instance

    $ yarn start injest < objects.json
